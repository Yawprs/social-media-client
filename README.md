## Why?

~After a long pandemic and 2 months of sitting in front of a computer we all decided we needed a vacation, or at least to think about vacations. So came to be Beach Bums.

## MVP

~The minimum vialable product for this was to create our own API database as well as a client side. We had to make three models, and utilize them in our app. Part of our MVP was to create, update, or delete and account. That user should be able to follow other users, post their own statuses, and comment on theirs and others posts.

## How?

~Beach Bums uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, React, and Mongoose. We collaborated as a team over one week using slack and notion. 

## Stretch goals!

~Our stretch goals were to create a like button for posts as well as have the ability to follow other users.
